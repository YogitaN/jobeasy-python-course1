# FOR LOOPS EXERCISES

# Ex. 1
# Enter your name, save it in name variable and save in result_1 variable your name repeated 3 times (use loops)

# TODO: Here is your code
for i in range(3):

# Ex. 2
# Modify your previous program so that it will enter your name (save it in variable  name_2) and a number
# (save in variable number) and then save in result_2 variable your name repeated as many times as number_1 is
# (use loops)
name_2 = 'Emily'

# TODO: Here is your code

for j in range(number_1):

print(result_2)




# Ex. 3
# Enter a random string, which includes only digits. Write code which find a sum of digits in this string and save it
# into result_3 variable

# TODO: Here is your code

for count in string_number_1:

# Ex. 4
# Create code which sums up all even numbers between 2 and 100 (include 100) and save it in result_4 variable

# TODO: Here is your code
for k in range(2, 101, 2):
